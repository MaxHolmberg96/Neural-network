# Neural Network applied on CIFAR-10
The neural network supports n hidden layers and is implemented with several tweaks to increase accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Such tweaks involve data augmentation, dropout, cyclic learning rate scheme.

The network achieves 57% test accuracy when trained with 290 hidden nodes, data augmentation and regularization of the loss function. This is achieved when training for 8 learning rate cycles.
